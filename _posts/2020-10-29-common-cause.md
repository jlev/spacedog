Like many Americans, we were very concerned about the potential for disruption or interference in the 2020 election. Common Cause has been tracking elections for years, and tasked us to build a system to get the word out quickly in the event of changing rules or misinformation.

We designed a site to house this information in an official looking and readable format, using the US Web Design Standards and the existing Common Cause branding. We used a static framework to withstand any election day traffic spikes, and a user-friendly admin to allow rapid updates by campaign staff. Prominent share links encouraged visitors to share with their networks on Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, SMS, Twitter and email, and sign up for further updates. Content could be translated into multiple languages, to reach every community. Short SMS-friendly links were provided, and we loaded in 50+ to prepare voters to report Election Day issues via the 866-OUR-VOTE hotline.

Thousands of viewers saw and shared these pages on Election Day, and the site saw no downtime or performance issues.
