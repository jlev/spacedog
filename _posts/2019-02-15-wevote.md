WeVote is an innovative social ballot application designed and built by volunteers. As they scale their data and endorsements, we performed a thorough review of the initial on-boarding and ballot creation flows to ensure ease of use, visual simplicity and coherent structure.

We led design meetings with principals and interns, providing guiding briefs for specific user interface challenges. Deliverables included a comprehensive review of existing designs, Sketch files with revisions and improvements, and implementation advice for critical details.

WeVote recently was awarded support from FastForward, ensuring that it can continue to help voters in 2019, 2020 and beyond.
