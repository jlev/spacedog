description: Well, that was another memorable year

Well, 2016 was another busy year. To recap we:

* helped [Vote.org](/mission/vote-org/) prepare for public launch and acceleration with Y-Combinator, rebuilding several of their rails applications to help three million new voters this cycle
* traveled to Guyana with DigitalDemocracy for their [board retreat](/mission/digidem-retreat/), where we provided strategic and technical insight on their product vision
* built an amazing [voter registration chatbot](/mission/hellovote/) with Fight for the Future, and helped almost 160,000 voters check their registration or submit a new one with their state
* watched with dismay on [November 3rd](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2016/11/09/november-9th-3am) as the election challenged our belief in the moral arc of the universe 
* traveled to [Belfast](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2016/08/26/belfast), [Berlin](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2016/12/12/learning-from-history-berlin), [Budapest](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2016/12/18/budapest) and [Barcelona](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2016/12/21/barcelona-2) to remind ourselves of the recent history of authoritarianism in liberal democracies, and to recommit ourselves to the transnational struggle against fascism
