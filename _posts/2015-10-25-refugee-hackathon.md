Millions of people from Syria, Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, and countries across central and western Africa are fleeing violence, poverty and privation, becoming refugees not out of choice but necessity. The scale of this crisis has forced Europe to confront both its role in seemingly distant conflicts and its own historical memories. Stories and images of people crossing vast distances against severe odds to reach safety and a better life compel us to respond with our shared humanity. As governments and international bodies fail their charges, organizations and individuals are moved to act in any way they can.

[RefugeeHackathon.de](http://refugeehackathon.de) is one response to the crisis organized by German technologists, designers and humanitarians. We learned of the project only a few weeks ago, but felt that our experience and skills could be useful. [Ruth](http://ruthmiller.net) volunteered her skills as a facilitator and designer, and I offered of experience at other international hackathons and working in the Middle East. We bought plane tickets from California to Berlin, and prepared to assist in any way we could.

### Day 1 - Listening and Learning

We arrived tired from the flight but ready to dive in. Participants gathered at the [Haus der Demokratie und Menschenrechte](http://hausderdemokratie.de/artikel/welcome.php4) to hear from refugees and volunteers about the obstacles they are facing, the changes they would like to see, and to generate possible solutions. From the beginning there was the acknowledgement that technology cannot fix bad policies, and we should avoid recreating duplicate platforms, and be aware of reinforcing existing hierarchies and power structures.

Most of the 70 participants were German, with a half-dozen young men from Cameroon and a few from Syria and Afghanistan. The *lingua franca* was English, which was immensely helpful to me as I don't speak German, but unhelpful to the Cameroonians who don't either. I was able to summon what remains of my high-school level French, and while it was difficult to think and translate simultaneously, it was incredibly helpful to hear their stories and convey empathy, even if I could not always converse in detail.

One young man told my small group about his journey from Cameroon to Niger, across the Sahara, crossing the dangerous Moroccan border where several of his friends were killed, finally making it to Spain and then eventually Germany. When someone asked him "why Germany", he told us he had heard it was a country that respects human rights. We are doing our best to prove that true.

Because of the precarious position of many of the participants, we needed to be sensitive to their need for privacy and anonymity. People could put red dots on their name tags if they did not wish to be photographed, a common practice in security-conscious [facilitation](https://aspirationtech.org). However this message was not well conveyed to the French speakers, and when a reporter asked a group I was speaking to if he could take some photographs, I translated to the best of my ability. I tried to make clear that this was voluntary, and each person should do it only if they wanted to, but I did not clearly see the power dynamic at play until the shoot began.

Afterwards one of the participants asked where the photos might be published, and when I said *un magasin* he was surprised and unhappy. As we discussed his concerns about potential retaliation, I recognized my role in the situation and requested that the journalist delete the photographs, which he did with some dismay. A lesson for future events: make clear to all attendees their rights to privacy and to control their own level of participation, and ensure that the "no photos" signal is visible and respected.

After a full day of talking with refugees and volunteers about their experiences, our groups split up to brainstorm solutions. These ideas will be the inputs for designers and coders tomorrow, and it is important that they are rooted in real user needs. Our small group focused on integrating existing information with popular distribution methods. We decided that a multi-channel messaging system is needed to connect refugees to volunteers who can answer basic questions over WhatsApp or SMS, backed by a database with links to existing resources. We later learned that this is similar in concept to [Wefugee.org](http://www.wefugee.org), although I think that the ability to ask questions via text message is important, and I hope to convince more developers of the utility of building tools for mobile first, instead of necessarily apps or websites.

The full group ended up with more than twenty posters laying out various problems and potential solutions. Of course many had overlaps and not all will necessarily be built, but getting participants to start with problems first instead of solutions provided a good basis to ensure the hackathon results in useful tools beyond this weekend.
