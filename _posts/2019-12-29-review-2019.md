Yowza, 2019 was another year. To recap we:

- reviewed and improved user experience and designs with [WeVote](/mission/wevote/) 
- enabled [VoteFwd](/mission/votefwd/) volunteers to send pre-filled registration letters to voters
- built out [TextPower](/mission/textpower/) with Eugene Flynn of 54Degrees, and piloted with a major UK charity
- helped [TeamTrees](/mission/teamtrees/) raise $20 million, preparing their website and action platforms for launch
- set up CallPower for ActionPAC and their campaign to [Free Rodney Reed](/mission/freerodneyreed/), saving an innocent man from execution
- experienced Burning Man [metamorphosis](https://www.levinger.net/josh/2019/08/31/burning-man-metamorphosis) and renewed my energy to build a better world
- searched for an outlet to do even more meaningful and scalable work in 2020, and finally found it (details to follow)
