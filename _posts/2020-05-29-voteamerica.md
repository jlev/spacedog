We worked with the [amazing team at VoteAmerica](https://voteamerica.com/team) to design and implement voter verification, online registration, vote-by-mail ballot request and polling place lookup tools. As one of the first technology hires, we helped refine their product offerings by writing detailed specs and user documentation, performing code reviews, and giving demonstrations for potential partners.

With COVID-19 making traditional elections even more dificult in 2020, we reviewed vote-by-mail processes and forms in all 50 states and DC and designed a simple web flow for voters to request an absentee ballot online. We tested computer vision techniques to extract hand-written signatures and apply them to PDFs for fax and email delivery directly to local election officials, simplifying a complex and confusing process.

We leveraged a decade of experience with [RockTheVote](/mission/rockthevote), [Vote.org](/mission/vote-org), [HelloVote](/mission/hellovote), [WeVote](/mission/wevote), [VoteFwd](/mission/votefwd) and the [Libyan High National Elections Commission](/mission/libyan-elections) to bring world-class insight into voter registration and elections systems, and we are proud of the work we accomplished in six months. We are confident that VoteAmerica's tools are the best available in 2020, and wish the team success in saving democracy.
