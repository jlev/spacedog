After the vote itself, we shared the widespread concern that the legitimate results would be respected and reported accurately. Working with [Corelab](http://corelab.co) and the [Center for Impact Communications](https://impactcomms.org), we quickly built a site to display ballot totals through the early voting period in seven battleground states, and made preparations for a long counting process.

We designed easy-to-understand visualizations of the type of ballots counted per day, and wrote scrapers to gather and collate data from multiple sources. Using the Gatsby static site generator and the Ghost blogging platform, we ensured that content was easy to update and charts were quick to load.

Individual state guides provided crucial context to understanding the counting process, and watching the machinery of democracy at work.
