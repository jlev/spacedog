Whew, 2015 was a busy year. To recap we:

* peformed a security and privacy audit with the PublicLab for WhereWeBreathe
* traveled to Peru with DigitalDemocracy for [HackTheRainforest](/mission/hacktherainforest/), where we designed offline data collection tools for indigenous environmental defense
* built a story-sharing platform with a team at UC Davis for [Stories of Solidarity](/mission/stories-of-solidarity/), and redesigned the map to be easier to search and understand information in context  
* launched an open source call-tool with the EFF, Fight for the Future, Demand Progress, ColorOfChange, Presente, and others. We are continuing to improve the hosted product [CallPower](/mission/callpower/) with clients like the Center for Popular Democracy, Jewish Voice for Peace, SumOfUs and CREDO Action
* traveled to Berlin for the [Refugee Hackathon](/mission/refugee-hackathon/), where we helped newcomers find government services on their mobile phones with LaGeSoNum
* went to amazing technology conferences including [Netroots](/posts/netroots/), [Web of Change](/posts/webofchange/), [Mobiles x Mobilisation](/posts/mobilesxmobilisation/) and the Non-Profit Developers Summit
* created a visualisation of terrorist attacks on womens health clinics with UltraViolet for [Stop Clinic Terror](/mission/stop-clinic-terror)
* implemented a library with [the engine room](/mission/engine-room-library/) to showcase their reports on microtasking and other applied research for advocacy
