Gosh, 2018 was another year. To recap we:

- deployed [RapidPro](http://rapidpro.github.io/rapidpro/) with Fight for the Future, enabling their campaigners to rapidly send engaging messages to their members
- reflected on the current state of the Israel/Palestine conflict and ongoing occupation in the West Bank and seige of Gaza [in Medium](https://medium.com/@jlev/this-year-in-jerusalem-3d98ffbaa15f)
- built [CrushTheMidterms](/mission/crush-the-midterms) with Purpose, to helped activists make personalized plans for the election
- canvassed with SwingLeft in CA-10, helping Josh Harder win and providing one of the seats needed to take back the House
- helped [Alianza.org](https://alianza.org) relaunch their website and mobilize 1 million Puerto Rican voters in Florida
- traveled to New Zealand and Australia, developing our skills at [landscape photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlevinger/albums/72157702230580781)
