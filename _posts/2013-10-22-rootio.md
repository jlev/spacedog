### Context ###

Despite the wonders of ubiquitous mobile Internet, in many places communities get the bulk of their information through a much older, but still vibrant technology: radio.  It doesn’t require literacy, a personal device, or significant electricity, it is transmitted free of charge, and it comes built in to many of the phones used around the world.

But radio is still a broadcast medium, and hasn’t yet benefited much from the advances in peer networks and cooperative production that the Internet has enabled. RootIO is a project to change that, providing a content-agnostic "solution stack" for peer-oriented radio networks.

### Engagement ###

We worked with the RootIO team to design their web and mobile platforms, specifying communication protocols and software architectures, and building user interfaces to program station content and NGO-funded advertising. We traveled to Los Angeles for two week-long code sprints, and to Kampala for a prototype demonstration with the Uganda Radio Network and the UNICEF Innovation Lab.
