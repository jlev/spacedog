VoteFwd reached out to us for help reviewing and adding features to their existing Node.js application. We implemented voter registration form prefilling in 12 states using PDFtk, and improved deployment with a custom Dockerfile on Google Cloud.

Our deep experience with voter registration forms helped us make an impact quickly, and ensured compliance with state and federal regulations. With a pre-filled form, and VoteFwd's diligence at quantitative testing, we look forward to a statistically significant bump in registrations in 2019 and 2020.

Onward!
