Web of Change has been an important part of my personal and professional life over the past three years. It is where I first went to recharge after leaving my "real job", where I learned from peers how to start consulting on my own, and where I return to find strength in a vibrant community.

I am a natural cynic, and it initially seemed a little too "woo-woo" for me. I assumed it would be all trust falls and long hugs, and rolled my eyes at the thought of a summer camp for adults. But I followed the recommendation of a friend who suggested I go, and decided to at least play along for a few days. I am glad that I did, and pretending became practice.

The community is both incredibly welcoming and challenging itself to do better. What was once a group of mostly techies in the Canadian environmental movement has become a resiliant organization with many inspiring organizers of color from across the continent. It may have shifted from my own personal focus on technology building, but the reminder that as change-makers we need to "[build with, not for](http://www.buildwith.org)" users provides grounding in the movement.

If you're looking for a space to take a break from the every day to think about building a better future, I highly recommend Web of Change.
