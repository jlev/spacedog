May 2020 was a terrible month in America. The ongoing horror of systemic racism and unjust use of force against Black Americans reared again into public visibility, with three high-profile murders which inspired national calls for justice.

ActionPAC responded by building microsites with CallPower campaigns embedded at [Run With Maud](https://www.runwithmaud.com/), [Stand With Bre](https://www.standwithbre.com/) and [Justice for Big Floyd](https://www.justiceforbigfloyd.com/). Together, these sites placed over 800,000 calls (peaking at 12 calls per second), by far the biggest month of usage for the tool to date. We are proud for the small role our open technology played in these campaigns, and for the trust our partners have placed in us to scale with them in moments of need.

We have worked in this space for several years, since our early work on [Killed by Cops](/mission/killedbycops) with Color of Change in 2014. We are still shocked and dismayed by the toll that racist and militarized policing takes on our society. We fully support the Movement for Black Lives, and the ongoing community and street actions to force this nation to confront our brutality.

Towards a better world,
