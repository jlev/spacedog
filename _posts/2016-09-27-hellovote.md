### Context ###

[Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) is a non-profit dedicated to expanding the internet's transformative power for good. They are skilled digital campaigners who helped lead the net neutrality fight, and orchestrated a [Vote with Friends](http://www.votewithfriends.net) campaign in 2012 to connect Facebook users to get out the vote in important states. They have significant in-house technical and product expertise, and we were thrilled to be able to work with them on an exciting new project.

### Engagement ###

With our experience building new voter interfaces with [RockTheVote](/mission/rockthevote/), the [Libyan High Elections Commission](/mission/libyan-elections/), and [Vote.org](/mission/vote-org/), we have built expertise in innovating the voter registration experience. With Fight for the Future we have built a super easy interactive voter registration system that works entirely over messaging platforms.

HelloVote asks a series of straightforward questions like your address, date of birth and state ID number, checks to verify your existing registration, and generates a form for you. Using a combination of Node.js and Python, we are able to integrate with six states directly, ensuring that people are registered to vote instantly. In all other states, we send users a filled-out form that they can mail to their local election official, and even include a stamp.

We launched in the week before National Voter Registration Day to great press and a lot of social media excitement. HelloVote was covered in [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/register-to-vote-via-text-facebook-hellovote-2016-9), [Bustle](http://www.bustle.com/articles/185688-how-to-register-to-vote-on-facebook-using-hellovote-the-answer-to-the-busy-millennials-prayers), [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/hellovote-voter-registration-texting-facebook-messenger-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election/), [CNN Money](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/hellovote-text-to-vote/), [FastCompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/3063969/mind-and-machine/this-chatbot-will-register-you-to-vote-by-text-so-now-you-have-no-excuse), [Glamour](http://www.glamour.com/story/register-to-vote-with-a-text-message), [Recode](http://www.recode.net/2016/9/22/13020980/chatbot-voter-registration-text), [Seventeen](http://www.seventeen.com/life/tech-social-media/news/a42975/no-more-excuses-you-can-now-register-to-vote-through-test-message/) and [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/22/backed-by-anti-trump-twilio-this-bot-wants-to-register-voters/). We were also tweeted in the same day by Ellen Degeneres, Bernie Sanders, Mindy Kaling, and internet impresarios Xeni Jardin and Anil Dash. MTV also featured our shortcode [384-387](sms://384387) on a one-day resurrection of TRL, redubbed [Total Registrations Live](http://electthis.com/trl), which included appearances by Kendall Jenner, Joss Whedon, Common, Ty Dolla $ign, and Nico Tortorello.
