Wow, 2017 was quite a crazy year. To recap we:

* expanded [CallPower](/mission/callpower-collaboration) to a dozen organizations, which placed over _2 million_ phone calls to Congress. Many thanks to CREDO and Fight for the Future in trusting our technology to scale and deliver impact in our important fights together.
* continued experimenting with chatbots for engaging two-way communications over messaging platforms, working with ParentsTogether, 54Degrees, and Concern Worldwide
* helped out organizations like MiddleSeat, ACLU PeoplePower, and LeadNow.ca by providing emergency technical support or coverage during vacations or staff transitions
* gave talks at Twilio's [SignalConf](/blog/twilio-signal), the [MIT Media Lab](/blog/viral-political-communications), [CubaConf](/mission/cubaconf) in Havana and attended Netroots Nation in Atlanta GA
* launched [OpenSourceActivism.tech](https://opensourceactivism.tech), to try and broaden the conversation about the ownership of political technology and activism tools
* visited Vienna, Istanbul, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Seoul
* stood in the path of the [total solar eclipse](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jlevinger/36724230885/) in Idaho, and remembered that we are small in the face of an awesome universe
